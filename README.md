# YouTubeDislikes
Archiving YouTube dislikes (and other video information) with YouTube's api!

## How to use?
* Make sure curl, parallel, grep, is installed.
* Add your video ids to ids.txt, or use the default ones from sponsorblock, however I've already archived them.
* Run bash start.sh
* Tell YouTube to fuck off.
## Datasets
* ids.txt - This file contains every video from [SponsorBlock's database](https://sponsor.ajay.app/database)
* https://archive.org/details/archived_annotations_video_ids.csv
